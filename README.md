## Background
This project pertains to team formation in groups of humans and robots trying to accomplish a common objective, such as a search and rescue operation. Teams succeed because of the network of relationships they possess, and the emergent behaviors this network facilitates. These emergent behaviors arise due to three constructs: (a) multiple agents in the team capable of taking actions, (b) interactions between the agents, and (c\) emergence of global-scale patterns due to the interactions. The overall research strategy and objective tackles each of these constructs as separate tasks in the context of a search and rescue mission. Search and rescue operations are often severely resource constrained in terms of time, energy, and information organization. Operating in such resource-constrained scenarios can impact the ability of human-agent teams to tackle complex problems, resulting in sub-optimal outputs.

## Objective
This study is largely exploratory. We will vary study parameters such as the goal assigned to the human-robot team, the complexity of the search and rescue environment, and the resources available to the team (such as level of map detail). We will observe and measure the resulting trust between humans and robots in the team, as well as the level of team performance and cohesion.
