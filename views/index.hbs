			the current state of the whole map, the human explored area, and the agent explored area. You will be prompted 
			to either integrate or discard both agents' explored regions (Agent 1 and Agent 2). If you choose to integrate, the agent explored region 
			(shaded green/orange) will turn red. If you choose to discard this area, the green/orange colored region will disappear and is 
			considered unexplored.
